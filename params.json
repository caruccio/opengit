{"name":"Opengit","tagline":"Open your github project page from your terminal","body":"### Welcome to Opengit\r\n\r\nThis script is really simple and as expected does one simple thing:\r\n\r\nIt will open your git project on github.com from your terminal\r\n\r\n### Here is how you use it\r\n\r\nTo open the current branch\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ opengit\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo open a specific branch, just name it\r\n```\r\n$ opengit your-cool-branch-name\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will check if the branch (current or passed as argument) exists on the remote side (github.com).\r\n\r\nThat's it, really simple and you should try it, you'll love it :smile:\r\n\r\n### And this is how you install it\r\n\r\nThese instructions are for Linux, OS X users should make the necessary substitutions, if any, I know nothing about OS X.\r\n\r\nCreate a directory `~/bin`\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nmkdir -p \"$HOME/bin\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd the directory to the beginning of the `PATH` variable inside `.bashrc`\r\n\r\n```shell\r\necho 'PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"' >> \"$HOME/.bashrc\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, every new instance of Bash will now check for executable scripts in your bin directory.\r\n\r\nNow you save the file `opengit` inside the `~/bin` directory and make the file executable with:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nchmod +x opengit\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf for some reason you don't want/can't grant the permissions, you can run it like this:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nbash opengit\r\n```\r\n\r\nPower to you my friend!","google":"UA-46815649-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
